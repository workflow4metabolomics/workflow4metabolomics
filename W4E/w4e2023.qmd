Since 2014, Workflow4Metabolomics organizes its own school during one week. It aims to analyze your data with Galaxy and the Workflow4metabolomics infrastructure! The 2023 Workflow4Experimenters session (W4E2023) took place in March 2023. During this one-week course (entirely in English), you learned how to use the W4M infrastructure and analyzed your own LC-MS, GC-MS, or NMR data.


For this 2023 new session, format changed:

• From March, 6th to 10th (10am to 12pm): online theoretical sessions (methods and tools)

• From March, 20th to 24th: tutoring on your own data, at *Institut des systèmes complexes* (Paris). Practical information - access map
