Young bioinformatician (yet) working on development of Shiny applications as principal activity. I love the development part of a tool because it is always a new challenge to share with diferent biologist and send them the tool that they need.

I also play a lot of volley-ball and snow volley-ball during my free time ! I'm also the happy father of a little boy since 3 months and don't sleep a lot since but I'm full of love.

## Education

**Technical certificate** in laboratory analysis in 2012

**Master degree** in BioInfomatic in 2017

## Experience
