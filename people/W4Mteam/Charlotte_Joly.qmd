Assistant Engineer in mass spectrometry applied to metabolomics.
I carry out metabolomics studies includingÂ : sample preparation, analyte extraction, LC-MS acquisition and data processing. Biomarker annotation and quantification is a motivating challenge that I am trying to answer.
On my free time I play handball and I'm also a firefighter.
