I am an agronomist that felt into mass spectrometry based metabolomics and even worth into bioinformatics. I am a technology lover and do think that by fully understanding how our mass spectrometers work we can achieve more. I see in Galaxy W4M a great opportunity to exchange with colleagues and create with them better basis for FAIR Science.
I am also the happy father of 2 and a big fan of cuisine
