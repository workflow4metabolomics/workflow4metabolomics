    "text": "Tool dependencies using Conda\nWriting a tool\nWriting a tool using Planemo\nTesting a tool using Planemo\nUsing Ant to run Planemo\nAutomate testing within GitHub using Travis\nPublish a tool in the ToolShed using Planemo\n\n\n\nA tool may require to operate some external softwares (call dependencies) like binaries, python or R packages/libraries. Conda is a package manager that among many other things can be used to manage Python packages. It became since july 2016, the default package manager within Galaxy. In Galaxy, Conda will search by default in 3 channels: defaults, r and bioconda\n\n\nGalaxy currently will use miniconda2 (Python 2.7), so prefer is then miniconda3.\n\n\nFollow this link http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html\n\n\n\n\nSee Installing Planemo\nplanemo conda_init --conda_prefix \"/usr/conda/\"\n\n\n\n\nFor testing your recipe, you will need conda.\nInstalling miniconda on macOS:\nbrew cask install miniconda\nThe installation is done in ~/miniconda3. The binaries are installed inside ~/miniconda3/bin.\n\n\n\nThen install conda-build:\n~/miniconda3/bin/conda install conda-build\n\n\n\n\nThe tests may fail if the requirements cannot be found neither in conda nor in bioconda. Thus you may be forced to develop a new recipe for bioconda in order for the tests to pass.\nTo develop a new recipe, either ask to be part of Bioconda team for contributing to new recipes (repository bioconda-recipes) as explained in Bioconda recipes README, or fork bioconda-recipes and send a pull-request.\nFollow the instructions in Bioconda recipes README.\n\n\nTo write your recipe, follow the instructions in Guidelines for bioconda recipes. You will find instructions for each development language.\n\n\nFor writing a recipe for a R CRAN package, use the skeleton generator:\ncd recipes\n~/miniconda3/bin/conda skeleton cran mypkg\n\n\n\nFor writing a recipe for a Bioconductor package, use the specific generator:\npython3 scripts/bioconductor/bioconductor_skeleton.py mypkg\nPython3 is required, but is not explicitly called by this script, so you need to specify it unless it is the default on your system. Make sure that you have installed the necessary packages for this script:\npip3 install pyaml bs4 requests\n\n\n\n\nTo build your recipe, run:\n~/miniconda3/bin/conda build recipes/myrecipe\nIf it is a R package add the option --channel r, and if it depends on other bioconda recipes add --channel bioconda.\nSee also Conda build recipes.\n\n\n\nNow you just have to send a pull-request and wait, Travis CI will run the tests, and merge your recipe automatically into the master branch in case of success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a reference, see the Tool XML file syntax from the Galaxy project wiki. The Galaxy Intergalactic Utilities Commission Standards and Best Practices are also worth reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanemo is part of the Galaxy project, and is made for easing the development and testing of Galaxy tools. A documentation is available, so we will give here only the basic knowledge. A French course (slides) given at the Galaxy Day (Nov. 11 2015) is also available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Planemo\n\nvirtualenv ~/.planemo-venv\n. ~/.planemo-venv/bin/activate\npip install planemo\n\nBefore using Planemo on your terminal, you will need to activate your virtualenv environment:\n\n. ~/.planemo-venv/bin/activate\n\n\n\nUnder macOS, you can also use Homebrew for installing Planemo:\nbrew tap galaxyproject/tap\nbrew install planemo\n\n\n\nplanemo init will create a file in the home directory called .planemo.yml where you will be able to set your ToolShed credentials\n\n\n\n\nPlanemo propose to create the tool skeloton\nplanemo tool_init\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sections of your tool XML file, must be in the specific order:\n\n&lt;description&gt;\n&lt;requirements&gt;\n&lt;command&gt;\n&lt;inputs&gt;\n&lt;outputs&gt;\n&lt;tests&gt;\n&lt;help&gt;\n&lt;citations&gt;\n\n\n\n\nIf your script mytool-script is written in R, and have the following R library dependencies: batch, PMCMR, you have to define the following lines inside your tool XML file:\n&lt;requirements&gt;\n    &lt;requirement type=\"package\" version=\"3.2.2\"&gt;R&lt;/requirement&gt;\n    &lt;requirement type=\"package\"&gt;r-batch&lt;/requirement&gt;\n    &lt;requirement type=\"package\"&gt;r-pmcmr&lt;/requirement&gt;\n&lt;/requirements&gt;\nRequirements will be looked for inside 3 channels: default, r, and bioconda GitHub repository and installed by conda inside a virtual environment. Thus you can check there if your particular package is defined, or if the specific version your tool requests is provided. In this example, the R language version 3.2.2 will be installed, as well as the batch and PMCMR R libraries (no version specified, but that could have been possible).\n\n\n\nYou must not use anymore the attribute interpreter inside the command tag. The command content will be launched inside a bash session. The programs called must be present inside the PATH, so it must be a standard program (unless you find a way to put your tool program inside the PATH, but we do not recommand that).\nHere is an example with a script in R:\n&lt;command&gt;&lt;![CDATA[\n    Rscript $__tool_directory__/mytool-script\n    ...\n]]&gt;&lt;/command&gt;\nNote the use of the $__tool_directory__ variable. This is because, according to our experience, planemo test may fail to find your script if the whole is not specified.\n\n\n\nAt least one test is required.\nThe param tags describe the inputs.\n&lt;tests&gt;\n    &lt;test&gt;\n        &lt;param name=\"dbfile\" value=\"filedb.tsv\"/&gt;\n        &lt;param name=\"mzrtinput\" value=\"mzrt-input-small.tsv\"/&gt;\n        &lt;param name=\"inputfields\" value=\"\"/&gt;\n        &lt;param name=\"mzmode\" value=\"pos\"/&gt;\n        &lt;output name=\"mainoutput\" file=\"filedb-small-mz-match-output.tsv\"/&gt;\n        &lt;output name=\"peaksoutput\" file=\"filedb-small-mz-match-peaks-output.tsv\"/&gt;\n        &lt;output name=\"htmloutput\" file=\"filedb-small-mz-match-html-output.html\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/test&gt;\n&lt;/tests&gt;\nThe input and output files must be placed in a folder named test-data in the same location as your tool XML file.\nMore documentation here: https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Admin/Tools/WritingTests.\nBe careful, when referencing parameters that are included in a conditional section. You must not use the name of the conditional section as a prefix. For instance, if you have the following conditional section:\n&lt;conditional name=\"db\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;param name=\"dbtype\" label=\"Database\" type=\"select\"&gt;\n        &lt;option value=\"inhouse\"&gt;In-house&lt;/option&gt;\n        &lt;option value=\"peakforest\"&gt;Peakforest&lt;/option&gt;\n    &lt;/param&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- .... --&gt;\n&lt;/conditional&gt;\nYou will use the parameter name dbtype as is, without prefix:\n&lt;tests&gt;\n    &lt;test&gt;\n        &lt;param name=\"dbfile\" value=\"filedb.tsv\"/&gt;\n    &lt;!-- .... --&gt;\n    &lt;/test&gt;\n&lt;/tests&gt;\n\n\n\nAn help section is required.\n\n\n\nThis sections is required, as a good practice. In the case you have nothing to put inside this section, and in order to make the planemo lint pass, just write an empty section:\n&lt;citations/&gt;\n\n\n\n\nRunning planemo on an XML tool file:\nplanemo lint mytool.xml\nIt will output a list of checks as the following one:\nApplying linter tests... CHECK\n.. CHECK: 1 test(s) found.\nApplying linter stdio... CHECK\n.. INFO: No stdio definition found, tool will determine an error from stderr.\nApplying linter output... CHECK\n..

WARNING: When testing the requirements, it may be that you forget to specify some requirements for your tool, but that your test pass anyway. This is because the requirements were already installed inside ~/miniconda2, possibly while testing another tool.\nA first solution to avoid this is to erase the ~/miniconda2 before running planemo conda_install ..\nA second solution is to choose a custom folder for conda for your tool through the --conda_prefix option:\nplanemo conda_init --conda_prefix /tmp/conda\nplanemo conda_install --conda_prefix /tmp/conda mytool.xml\nplanemo test --install_galaxy --galaxy_branch release_16.01 --conda_prefix /tmp/conda --conda_dependency_resolution mytool.xml\nAttention to not choose a too much long prefix, otherwise it could give issue with R Ncurses package, in case your tool depends on it. You would get the error Error: ERROR: placeholder '/Users/aaronmeurer/anaconda/envs/_build_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_' too short in: ncurses-5.9-1. This issue will be solved in Conda-Build 2.0.0.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a build.xml file you can use as a base for running Planemo from Ant:\n&lt;project name=\"mytool\" default=\"all\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;property name=\"tool.xml\" value=\"mytool.xml\"/&gt;\n    &lt;property name=\"conda.dir\" value=\"${user.home}/w4m-conda\"/&gt;\n\n    &lt;!--~~~\n    ~ ALL ~\n    ~~~~~--&gt;\n\n    &lt;target name=\"all\"/&gt;\n\n    &lt;!--~~~~\n    ~ TEST ~\n    ~~~~~--&gt;\n\n    &lt;target name=\"test\" depends=\"planemo.lint,planemo.test\"/&gt;\n\n    &lt;!--~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    ~ PLANEMO LINT ~\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~--&gt;\n\n    &lt;target name=\"planemo.lint\"&gt;\n        &lt;exec executable=\"planemo\" failonerror=\"true\"&gt;\n            &lt;arg value=\"lint\"/&gt;\n            &lt;arg value=\"${tool.xml}\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/exec&gt;\n    &lt;/target&gt;\n\n    &lt;!--~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    ~ PLANEMO TEST ~\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~--&gt;\n\n    &lt;target name=\"planemo.test\" depends=\"planemo.conda.install\"&gt;\n        &lt;exec executable=\"planemo\" failonerror=\"true\"&gt;\n            &lt;arg value=\"test\"/&gt;\n            &lt;arg value=\"--conda_prefix\"/&gt;\n            &lt;arg value=\"${conda.dir}\"/&gt;\n            &lt;arg value=\"--galaxy_branch\"/&gt;\n            &lt;arg value=\"release_16.01\"/&gt;\n            &lt;arg value=\"--conda_dependency_resolution\"/&gt;\n            &lt;arg value=\"${tool.xml}\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/exec&gt;\n    &lt;/target&gt;\n\n    &lt;!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    ~ PLANEMO CONDA INSTALL ~\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~--&gt;\n\n    &lt;target name=\"planemo.conda.install\" depends=\"planemo.conda.init\"&gt;\n        &lt;exec executable=\"planemo\" failonerror=\"true\"&gt;\n            &lt;arg value=\"conda_install\"/&gt;\n            &lt;arg value=\"--conda_prefix\"/&gt;\n            &lt;arg value=\"${conda.dir}\"/&gt;\n            &lt;arg value=\"${tool.xml}\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/exec&gt;\n    &lt;/target&gt;\n\n    &lt;!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    ~ PLANEMO CONDA INIT ~\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~--&gt;\n\n    &lt;target name=\"planemo.conda.init\"&gt;\n        &lt;exec executable=\"planemo\" failonerror=\"true\"&gt;\n            &lt;arg value=\"conda_init\"/&gt;\n            &lt;arg value=\"--conda_prefix\"/&gt;\n            &lt;arg value=\"${conda.dir}\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/exec&gt;\n    &lt;/target&gt;\n\n    &lt;!--~~~~~\n    ~ CLEAN ~\n    ~~~~~~--&gt;\n\n    &lt;target name=\"clean\"&gt;\n        &lt;delete dir=\"${conda.dir}\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/target&gt;\n\n&lt;/project&gt;\n\n\n\nTravis CI is a continuous integration service, used in Workflow4Metabolomics.

    "text": "Tool dependencies using Conda\nWriting a tool\nWriting a tool using Planemo\nTesting a tool using Planemo\nUsing Ant to run Planemo\nAutomate testing within GitHub using Travis\nPublish a tool in the ToolShed using Planemo\n\n\n\nA tool may require to operate some external softwares (call dependencies) like binaries, python or R packages/libraries. Conda is a package manager that among many other things can be used to manage Python packages. It became since july 2016, the default package manager within Galaxy. In Galaxy, Conda will search by default in 3 channels: defaults, r and bioconda\n\n\nGalaxy currently will use miniconda2 (Python 2.7), so prefer is then miniconda3.\n\n\nFollow this link http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html\n\n\n\n\nSee Installing Planemo\nplanemo conda_init --conda_prefix \"/usr/conda/\"\n\n\n\n\nFor testing your recipe, you will need conda.\nInstalling miniconda on macOS:\nbrew cask install miniconda\nThe installation is done in ~/miniconda3. The binaries are installed inside ~/miniconda3/bin.\n\n\n\nThen install conda-build:\n~/miniconda3/bin/conda install conda-build\n\n\n\n\nThe tests may fail if the requirements cannot be found neither in conda nor in bioconda. Thus you may be forced to develop a new recipe for bioconda in order for the tests to pass.\nTo develop a new recipe, either ask to be part of Bioconda team for contributing to new recipes (repository bioconda-recipes) as explained in Bioconda recipes README, or fork bioconda-recipes and send a pull-request.\nFollow the instructions in Bioconda recipes README.\n\n\nTo write your recipe, follow the instructions in Guidelines for bioconda recipes. You will find instructions for each development language.\n\n\nFor writing a recipe for a R CRAN package, use the skeleton generator:\ncd recipes\n~/miniconda3/bin/conda skeleton cran mypkg\n\n\n\nFor writing a recipe for a Bioconductor package, use the specific generator:\npython3 scripts/bioconductor/bioconductor_skeleton.py mypkg\nPython3 is required, but is not explicitly called by this script, so you need to specify it unless it is the default on your system. Make sure that you have installed the necessary packages for this script:\npip3 install pyaml bs4 requests\n\n\n\n\nTo build your recipe, run:\n~/miniconda3/bin/conda build recipes/myrecipe\nIf it is a R package add the option --channel r, and if it depends on other bioconda recipes add --channel bioconda.\nSee also Conda build recipes.\n\n\n\nNow you just have to send a pull-request and wait, Travis CI will run the tests, and merge your recipe automatically into the master branch in case of success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a reference, see the Tool XML file syntax from the Galaxy project wiki. The Galaxy Intergalactic Utilities Commission Standards and Best Practices are also worth reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanemo is part of the Galaxy project, and is made for easing the development and testing of Galaxy tools. A documentation is available, so we will give here only the basic knowledge. A French course (slides) given at the Galaxy Day (Nov. 11 2015) is also available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Planemo\n\nvirtualenv ~/.planemo-venv\n. ~/.planemo-venv/bin/activate\npip install planemo\n\nBefore using Planemo on your terminal, you will need to activate your virtualenv environment:\n\n. ~/.planemo-venv/bin/activate\n\n\n\nUnder macOS, you can also use Homebrew for installing Planemo:\nbrew tap galaxyproject/tap\nbrew install planemo\n\n\n\nplanemo init will create a file in the home directory called .planemo.yml where you will be able to set your ToolShed credentials\n\n\n\n\nPlanemo propose to create the tool skeloton\nplanemo tool_init\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sections of your tool XML file, must be in the specific order:\n\n&lt;description&gt;\n&lt;requirements&gt;\n&lt;command&gt;\n&lt;inputs&gt;\n&lt;outputs&gt;\n&lt;tests&gt;\n&lt;help&gt;\n&lt;citations&gt;\n\n\n\n\nIf your script mytool-script is written in R, and have the following R library dependencies: batch, PMCMR, you have to define the following lines inside your tool XML file:\n&lt;requirements&gt;\n    &lt;requirement type=\"package\" version=\"3.2.2\"&gt;R&lt;/requirement&gt;\n    &lt;requirement type=\"package\"&gt;r-batch&lt;/requirement&gt;\n    &lt;requirement type=\"package\"&gt;r-pmcmr&lt;/requirement&gt;\n&lt;/requirements&gt;\nRequirements will be looked for inside 3 channels: default, r, and bioconda GitHub repository and installed by conda inside a virtual environment. Thus you can check there if your particular package is defined, or if the specific version your tool requests is provided. In this example, the R language version 3.2.2 will be installed, as well as the batch and PMCMR R libraries (no version specified, but that could have been possible).\n\n\n\nYou must not use anymore the attribute interpreter inside the command tag. The command content will be launched inside a bash session. The programs called must be present inside the PATH, so it must be a standard program (unless you find a way to put your tool program inside the PATH, but we do not recommand that).\nHere is an example with a script in R:\n&lt;command&gt;&lt;![CDATA[\n    Rscript $__tool_directory__/mytool-script\n    ...\n]]&gt;&lt;/command&gt;\nNote the use of the $__tool_directory__ variable. This is because, according to our experience, planemo test may fail to find your script if the whole is not specified.\n\n\n\nAt least one test is required.\nThe param tags describe the inputs.\n&lt;tests&gt;\n    &lt;test&gt;\n        &lt;param name=\"dbfile\" value=\"filedb.tsv\"/&gt;\n        &lt;param name=\"mzrtinput\" value=\"mzrt-input-small.tsv\"/&gt;\n        &lt;param name=\"inputfields\" value=\"\"/&gt;\n        &lt;param name=\"mzmode\" value=\"pos\"/&gt;\n        &lt;output name=\"mainoutput\" file=\"filedb-small-mz-match-output.tsv\"/&gt;\n        &lt;output name=\"peaksoutput\" file=\"filedb-small-mz-match-peaks-output.tsv\"/&gt;\n        &lt;output name=\"htmloutput\" file=\"filedb-small-mz-match-html-output.html\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/test&gt;\n&lt;/tests&gt;\nThe input and output files must be placed in a folder named test-data in the same location as your tool XML file.\nMore documentation here: https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Admin/Tools/WritingTests.\nBe careful, when referencing parameters that are included in a conditional section. You must not use the name of the conditional section as a prefix. For instance, if you have the following conditional section:\n&lt;conditional name=\"db\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;param name=\"dbtype\" label=\"Database\" type=\"select\"&gt;\n        &lt;option value=\"inhouse\"&gt;In-house&lt;/option&gt;\n        &lt;option value=\"peakforest\"&gt;Peakforest&lt;/option&gt;\n    &lt;/param&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- .... --&gt;\n&lt;/conditional&gt;\nYou will use the parameter name dbtype as is, without prefix:\n&lt;tests&gt;\n    &lt;test&gt;\n        &lt;param name=\"dbfile\" value=\"filedb.tsv\"/&gt;\n    &lt;!-- .... --&gt;\n    &lt;/test&gt;\n&lt;/tests&gt;\n\n\n\nAn help section is required.\n\n\n\nThis sections is required, as a good practice. In the case you have nothing to put inside this section, and in order to make the planemo lint pass, just write an empty section:\n&lt;citations/&gt;\n\n\n\n\nRunning planemo on an XML tool file:\nplanemo lint mytool.xml\nIt will output a list of checks as the following one:\nApplying linter tests... CHECK\n.. CHECK: 1 test(s) found.\nApplying linter stdio... CHECK\n.. INFO: No stdio definition found, tool will determine an error from stderr.\nApplying linter output... CHECK\n.. INFO: 2 outputs found.\nApplying linter inputs... CHECK\n.. INFO: Found 7 input parameters.\nApplying linter help... CHECK\n.. CHECK: Tool contains help section.\n..

CHECK: Tool defines an id [Univariate].\nApplying linter command... CHECK\n.. INFO: Tool contains a command.\n\n\n\nplanemo serve --install_galaxy \nIf you want to launch your tool in this Galaxy instance, you can follow instruction in the Run the tests on your tool section to install Conda dependencies and use planemo serve with --conda_dependency_resolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf not already done, initialize conda:\n\nplanemo conda_init\n\nInstall your tool requirements:\n\nplanemo conda_install mytool.xml\n\nRun your tests:\n\nplanemo test --install_galaxy --galaxy_branch release_16.01 --conda_dependency_resolution mytool.xml\n\n\nConda installs all its files inside ~/miniconda2 by default.
