## Our project 

The ![](/images/Workflow4Metabolomic_icon.svg){height=1em}, ![](/images/W4M_icon.svg){height=1em} in short, is a French infrastructure offering software tool processing, analyzing and annotating metabolomics data. It is based on the Galaxy platform. It was created in 2012 by Metabomer and Abims labs in order to provide an integrated analysis environment for Metabolomics. Since, other contributors joins us and now we are actually an international team of dozen of peoples from several Labs. 

In a collaborative efforts between metabolomics (
[![](https://www.metabohub.fr/media/752){height=1.5em}](https://www.metabohub.fr/) French infrastructure
) and bioinformatics platforms (
[![](https://www.france-bioinformatique.fr/wp-content/uploads/logo-ifb-couleur.svg){height=1.5em}](https://www.france-bioinformatique.fr/) Institut Fran√ßais de Bioinformatique
), we've crafted comprehensive LC/MS, GC/MS, and NMR pipelines using the robust
[![](https://galaxyproject.org/images/galaxy-logos/galaxy_logo_25percent.png){height=1em}](https://galaxyproject.org/)
framework.
Our **pipelines** cover the entire spectrum of data analysis, encompassing **preprocessing**, **normalization**, **quality control**, **statistical analysis**, and **annotation** steps.

These modular and adaptable workflows are carefully assembled with a combination of established components (such as
[XCMS](https://github.com/sneumann/xcms)
and
[CAMERA](https://github.com/sneumann/CAMERA)
packages) and a suite of tools developed by the ![](/images/W4M_icon.svg){height=1em} team members. Our implementation, accessible through a user-friendly web interface, ensures the completeness of parameter settings and reproducibility. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of 
[![](https://galaxyproject.org/images/galaxy-logos/galaxy_logo_25percent.png){height=1em}](https://galaxyproject.org/)
, we seamlessly integrate components from diverse sources and types.

This integration has facilitated the creation of an extensible Virtual Research Environment (VRE) tailored for metabolomics communities, including platforms and end-users. Our VRE offers preconfigured workflows for newcomers while catering to experts in the field. This collaborative approach not only ensures accessibility but also encourages knowledge-sharing and enhances the overall research experience.


## Galaxy

[![](https://galaxyproject.org/images/galaxy-logos/galaxy_logo_25percent.png){height=1em}](https://galaxyproject.org/) is an open, web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research. Whether on the free public server or your own instance, you can perform, reproduce, and share complete analyses.

The main features of this platform are:

* A real benefit to users with results traceability and storage
* The ability to share results between users/labs/platforms
* The possibility to use a complete analysis workflow managing environment
* Interactive step-by-step tutorials called [![](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/assets/images/GTN-60px.png){height=1em} Galaxy training](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/metabolomics/)
